# AsBrowser

Use VSCode as a browser.

## Intro

Execute `AsBrowser:Open` in the command palette, type URL and press `Enter`. And you can click the right end of address bar to fold/unfold.

Unlike VSCode's build-in [simple-browser](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/extensions/simple-browser) extension, this extension is much simpler and avoids a lot of bugs in code-server target.
