# AsBrowser

Use as a browser.

Itâ€™s not like [Browser Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=auchenberg.vscode-browser-preview) starts another headless browser, this extension using vscode's `webview` widget, cause less resources usage.

**Limitation:** Unsupport the pages which has strict [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy).
