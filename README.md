# AsBrowser

Use VSCode as a browser.

## Intro

Execute `AsBrowser: Open` in command palette, type URL and press `Enter`. You can click the right end to hide address bar.

Unlike VSCode's build-in [simple-browser](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/extensions/simple-browser) extension, this extension is much simpler and avoid a lot of bugs in code-server target.

Limitation: Unsupport the pages which has strict [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy).
